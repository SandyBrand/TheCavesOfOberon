# The Caves of Oberon – A Reverse Engineering Project

Welcome! This repository is the result of a personal hobby project where I did some 'digital archeology' and reverse-engineered
the map data of an old home computer game called **The Caves of Oberon**.

The version I grew up with was the Dutch release, _De Grotten van Oberon_, which was released all the way back in 1986 for MSX 1 home computers.

Using emulator tools and some scripting, I managed to reconstruct the **entire in-game map** as a giant animated image — so that, finally, after all these years, all the game's secrets are there for all to see.
